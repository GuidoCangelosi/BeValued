These worked from within VS Code terminal
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

ng g i interfaces/pet
returns error:
ng: file ... is not digitally signed

Solution

    Open up Windows Powershell as Administrator
    Run the following command: set-executionpolicy remotesigned
    You should be able to now run commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal for Angular and Node.js.




set-ExecutionPolicy : Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by
a policy defined at a more specific scope.  Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective
execution policy of AllSigned. Type "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List" to view your execution policy settings. For more
information please see "Get-Help Set-ExecutionPolicy".
